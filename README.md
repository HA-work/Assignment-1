# Assignment-1
A program to read in songs and output two lists.
I feel an array list with artist and track objects would be better than the 2D array and Linked List.
I still used the 2D array and linked list though for practice.
The file called Trial.java has the Main Class.

There are 2 output files.
The first has the unsorted artist list.
The second has the sorted artist list.
